âœ… Bot Instructions for Replit AI (Bot name: PotatoBoosting)
Create a Discord bot called PotatoBoosting with the following features:

ðŸ”¹ 1. On Member Join:
When a user joins the server, assign them a role named VsC.

This role allows them to see the ðŸ›’â”Šorder-here channel.

Create a button labeled Create Ticket or Order.

When the user clicks it:

Show a private Select Menu with the following options:

Paragon Leveling

Powerleveling

Gearing

Boss Kills

Boss Mats

Custom Order

This menu should only be visible to the user who clicked, not to others.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Ticket Channel Creation:
Based on the user's selection (e.g., Boss Kills), create a private text channel in the related category (e.g., Boss Kills).

The new channel name should include a unique ID to act as the order number.

Automatically redirect the user to that channel.

Reset the order-here channel to its default state.

If the user presses Close:

Delete the ticket channel automatically (if not confirmed).

Ready to start now or later?

After submitting the form:

Send the order details to a private channel for staff (mention the Staff role), including the unique order ID.

In the order channel, after confirmation, show buttons only visible to the Staff:

If Cancel is clicked:

Delete the ticket and notify staff.

If Complete is clicked:

Move the channel to a category called Completed Orders.

Revoke the userâ€™s access to that channel after 4 hours.

Remove the userâ€™s role that gave access to the ticket.

Send a private message to the user with a button/link that leads to a Reviews channel.

Each order channel should only be visible to the user and the Staff team.

No one else should have access.
